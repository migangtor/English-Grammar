### Possessive

#### Grammar Explanation

We can use possessive 's to talk about the relationship between people or to say who owns something. Possessive 's always comes after a noun or a name.

We often use possessive 's or s' when we talk about family and friends.

- Grandma and Grandpa are my mum's parents.
- Maria's best friend is Juanita.
- My cousins' birthdays are both in January.

We can also use it to say that something belongs to someone.

- That's Roberto's flat. He's got a flat in the city centre.
- Kim's hair is very long. She's got long, black hair.
- My parents' garden is beautiful. They grow a lot of flowers.

When it is one person who owns something, we usually use 's.

- Our friend's car is red. She loves it.
- Simon's phone is new. He bought it yesterday.
- Can you see Amira's keys? She can't find them.

It is possible to use more than one possessive in a phrase.

We had lunch at my friend's father's house.

If a name or noun ends in s, we can add either ' or 's. The pronunciation can be /zɪz/ or /sɪz/.

- Is that James' bag?
- That's my boss's office.
