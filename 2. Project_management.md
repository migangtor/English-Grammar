## The project life cycle

#### Initiate the project
In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

- Who are the stakeholders?
- What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
- What is the purpose and mission of the project?
- What are the measurable objectives for the team?
- What is the project trying to improve? 
- When does this project need to be completed? 
- What skills and resources will the project require? 
- What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

#### Make a plan
In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 

Create a detailed project plan. 
- What are the major milestones? 
- What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  

Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

#### Execute the project
In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 
- Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
- Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
- Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
- Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
- Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

#### Close the project
In this phase, close out the project.

- Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 
- Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.
- Take time with your team to celebrate your successes! 

Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.

Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.

Reflect on ways to improve in the future.

Key takeaway
Each phase of the project life cycle has its own significance and reason for existing. By following the project life cycle, you’re ensuring that you are: 
- Capturing the expectations of your customer
- Setting your project up for success with a plan
- Executing project tasks and addressing any issues that arise 
- Closing out your project to capture any lessons learned 

## Learning Organization's Culture

It is important to learn about the culture of the organization where you work or want to work. Understanding the company’s culture can help you navigate your team through a project. Consider this quote from Peter Drucker, an expert on management: "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." Drucker is implying that the culture of a company always influences its success, regardless of how effective the company’s business model may be.

#### Ask questions
You can learn about an organization's culture by asking questions of management and peers. It can be helpful to ask these questions in the interview phase to better understand the company’s culture before accepting a position. You might want to ask questions about:

#### Atmosphere
- What is the company’s dress code? 
- How do people typically share credit at this company? 
- Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail?
- How do managers support and motivate their team?
- How do people in this role interact with customers and users?
- When and how do team members give feedback to one another?
- What are some workplace traditions?
- What are some of the ways the company celebrates success?

#### Policies
- What are the policies around sick days and vacation?
- Does the company allow for employee flexibility (e.g., working from home, flexible working hours)?
- What policies are in place that support employees sharing their identity in the workplace?

#### Processes
- What is the company’s onboarding process?
- How do employees measure the impact of their work?

#### Values
- What are the company’s mission and value statements?
- How might the person in this role contribute to the organization’s mission?
- How does the organization support professional development and career growth?

#### Listen to people’s stories
Listening to what current employees have to say and how they portray the company will give you great insight.

- What were employees' experiences with similar projects in the past? 
- What can they tell you about key stakeholders and customers? 

#### Take note of company rituals
Rituals can be powerful drivers of culture. They engage people and help instill a sense of shared purpose and experience. 

- How are birthdays and holidays celebrated? 
- Do employees generally eat lunch at the same time and in the same place? 

Watch employee interactions: Observing how employees interact can help you tailor your interaction style to the company norm. 
- Are employee interactions more formal or informal in nature? 
- Are ideas solicited from employees in different roles? 

## Change management
Your project’s success depends on the adoption and acceptance of your project—whether that entails the launch of a new external tool or a process that will change operations at a production facility. In both cases, the greatest impact of the change will be on the people who use and interact with the product or process that is changing. 

Change management is a major undertaking and a project in and of itself. When it comes to change management, you may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end process. There will be times when your manager, a team member, or another senior leader might be responsible for taking on that transition and successfully implementing the changes. However, although you may not be the one directly leading the change, there are still ways in which you can support and participate in the successful adoption of your project. 

When you are thinking about change management as it relates to your project, begin by asking yourself the following questions:

- How will the organization react to change?
- Which influencers can affect change?
- What are the best means of communication? 
- What change management practices will lead to the successful implementation of my project? 

The answers to these questions will help you prepare for a variety of possible scenarios and allow you to craft solutions to effectively support the adoption of your project. 

#### Be proactive.
 
Proactive and inclusive change management planning can help keep any potentially impacted stakeholders aware of the upcoming changes.

- Incorporate change management into your project management steps. For example, you can schedule time during team meetings or create a feedback document to ensure that your team members know there is a place to voice their suggestions and concerns

- You can also plan steps towards the end of your project to introduce the deliverable to stakeholders in the form of demonstrations, question and answer forums, or marketing videos. You can factor all of these decisions into your plan so that any potential changes are less likely to impact your timeline. If these steps have not been built into your plan, you can escalate and stress the importance of a change management plan to your stakeholders. 

#### Communicate about upcoming changes. 

Communication should occur regularly among impacted stakeholders, the change management team, and the project team. Check in and communicate throughout the project about how the changes will provide a better experience for end users of the project deliverables. In this way, you support the process by providing everyone with the information they need to feel prepared to adjust to changes once the project is ready to launch. 

#### Follow a consistent process. 
Following a clear change management process helps maintain consistency each time there is a change. The change management process should be established and documented early on in your project to guide how the project will handle change. Your organization may also have an overarching change management plan that can be adopted for your project. This may include when the promotion of the change should happen, when training should occur, when the launch or release will occur, and corresponding steps for each phase of the process. 

- Feedback mechanisms, such as surveys, can capture input from stakeholders.

- [Flowcharts](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/what-is-a-flowchart-tutorial) can visualize the project's development process.

- [Culture mapping](https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-culture-map-a-systematic-intentional-tool-for-designing-great-company-culture) can illustrate the company's culture and how the company's values, norms, and employees behavior may be affected by the change.

As the project manager, you are responsible for successfully delivering projects. As you hone the skill set you acquire throughout this program, you will find that change management is essential to your projects’ success.

## Corporate and project governance

Governance in business is the management framework within which decisions are made and accountability and responsibility are determined. In simple terms, governance is understanding who is in charge.

### Corporate governance
Each organization is governed by its own set of standards and practices that direct and control its actions. Those standards and practices are called corporate governance, and they will influence your projects. 

### Project governance
Project governance is the framework for how project decisions are made. Project governance helps keep projects running smoothly, on time, and within budget. Project governance involves all the key elements that make a project successful. It tells you what activities an organization does and who is responsible for those activities. Project governance covers policies, regulations, functions, processes, procedures, and responsibilities. 

### How project and corporate governance intersect
Project governance needs to be tailored to your organization's specific needs. These needs will influence how you implement and monitor the governance framework on your project. Project governance concerns those areas of corporate governance that are specifically related to project activities. Effective project governance ensures that an organization’s projects are aligned to the organization’s larger objectives, are delivered efficiently, and are sustainable. This includes:

- Considering the long- and short-term interests of your organization
- Making thoughtful decisions about which projects to take on and avoiding projects if you do not have sufficient resources
- Providing timely, relevant, and reliable information to the board of directors and other major stakeholders 
- Eliciting the input and buy-in of senior managers since they are the decision-makers 
- During the initiation phase, prioritizing clear, reachable, and sustainable goals in order to reduce confusion and conflict
- During the planning phase, assigning ownership and accountability to an experienced team to deliver, monitor, and control the process 
- During the execution phase, learning from mistakes and adapting to new or improved knowledge

# 1. Project Initiation 

## 1.1 Performing a cost-benefit analysis
Cost-benefit analysis is the process of adding up the expected value of a project—the benefits—and comparing them to the dollar costs. In this reading, we will discuss the benefits of conducting a cost-benefit analysis, guiding questions to help you and your stakeholders conduct one, and how to calculate return on investment (ROI).



### The benefits of a cost-benefit analysis
A cost-benefit analysis can minimize risks and maximize gains for projects and organizations. It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives and keep your project on track. Because this type of analysis uses objective data, it can help reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions. 

Comparing a project’s benefits to its costs can help you make a strong business case to stakeholders and leadership and ensure your organization pursues the most profitable or useful projects. Organizations use cost-benefit analysis to reduce waste and invest their resources responsibly.

### Guiding questions for a cost-benefit analysis
When you’re pursuing a project, the benefits should outweigh the costs. It’s important for you and your stakeholders to consider questions like the ones that follow early on, while you prepare the proposal.

To determine the benefits of a project, you might ask:

- What value will this project create? 
- How much money could this project save our organization? 
- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
- How much time will it save? 
- How will it improve the customer experience?
- And to determine the costs of a project, consider questions such as:
- How much time will people have to spend on this project?
- What are the one-time costs?
- Are there any ongoing costs?
- What about long-term costs? 

You might also consider questions about intangible benefits. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:

- Customer satisfaction. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 
- Employee satisfaction. Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 
- Employee productivity. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?
- Brand perception. Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?

You can also flip these questions to consider intangible costs. These are costs that are not quantifiable. For example, might the project put customer retention, employee satisfaction, or brand perception at risk?

### Calculating costs and benefits
The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called calculating return on investment, or ROI. There are many ways to determine a project’s ROI, but the easiest way is to compare the upfront and ongoing costs to its benefits over time.

![alt text](image.png)

In this formula, G represents the financial gains you expect from the project, and C represents the upfront and ongoing costs of your investment in the project.

## 1.2 Setting your project goals

SMART goals: Making goals meaningful

Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART) goals are very helpful for ensuring project success. As you start your career in project management, you may not directly set the project goals, but you should be able to clarify and understand them. SMART goals help you see the full scope of a goal, determine its feasibility, and clearly define project success in concrete terms. 

- Specific: The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 
- Measurable: Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
- Attainable: The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
- Relevant: The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.
- Time-bound: The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

### Focusing on the "M" in SMART
Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the M in SMART, which stands for measurable. Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders. 

Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project. For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.

## Creating OKRs for your project

OKR stands for objectives and key results. They combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. 

![alt text](image-1.png)

OKRs and project management
As a project manager, OKRs can help you expand upon project goals and further clarify the deliverables you’ll need from the project to accomplish those goals. Project-level OKRs help establish the appropriate scope for your team so that you can say “no” to requests that may get in the way of them meeting their objectives. You can also create and use project-level OKRs to help motivate your team since OKRs are intended to challenge you to push past what’s easily achievable. 

#### Set your objectives
Project objectives should be aspirational, aligned with organizational goals, action-oriented, concrete, and significant. Consider the vision you and your stakeholders have for your project and determine what you want the project team to accomplish in 3–6 months.

Examples:
- Build the most secure data security software 
- Continuously improve web analytics and conversions
- Provide a top-performing service
- Make a universally-available app
- Increase market reach
- Achieve top sales among competitors in the region

Strong objectives meet the following criteria. They are:
- Aspirational
- Aligned with organizational goals
- Action-oriented
- Concrete
- Significant

To help shape each objective, ask yourself and your team:
- Does the objective help in achieving the project’s overall goals?
- Does the objective align with company and departmental OKRs?
- Is the objective inspiring and motivational?
- Will achieving the objective make a significant impact?

#### Develop key results
Next, add 2–3 key results for each objective. Key results should be time-bound. They can be used to indicate the amount of progress to achieve within a shorter period or to define whether you’ve met your objective at the end of the project. They should also challenge you and your team to stretch yourselves to achieve more.

Examples:
- X% new signups within first quarter post launch
- Increase advertiser spend by X% within the first two quarters of the year
- New feature adoption is at least X% by the end of the year
- Maximum 2 critical bugs are reported monthly by customers per Sprint
- Maintain newsletter unsubscribe rate at X% this calendar year

Strong key results meet the following criteria:
- Results-oriented—not a task
- Measurable and verifiable
- Specific and time-bound
- Aggressive yet realistic

To help shape your key results, ask yourself and your team the following:
- What does success mean?
- What metrics would prove that we’ve successfully achieved the objective?

**Share your OKRs with your team.** Once you’ve created OKRs for your project, it’s important to communicate them to your team so that everyone knows how to focus and align their efforts. You can do this by sharing a digital document, presenting them in a meeting, or adding them to an internal website. OKRs can help your project team stick to its goals, monitor which are falling short, and be continuously motivated to meet project objectives. 

##### Measuring progress
Measuring your OKRs is an important part of tracking and sharing your progress. One shortcut to determining the status of a project is to score or grade your OKRs. While scores or grades don’t provide a complete assessment of a project’s success, they’re helpful tools for determining how close you came to achieving your objectives. You can then share your OKR scores with project stakeholders and team members as part of your overall project updates.

Determine how you will score your OKRs. OKRs can be scored in different ways. You can score based on a percentage of the objective completed, the completion of certain milestones, or a scale of 1 to 10, for example. You can also use a “traffic light” scoring approach, where red means you didn’t make any progress, yellow means you made some progress, and green means you completed your objective.

The simplest approach to scoring OKRs is the “yes/no” method, with “yes” meaning you achieved your objective and “no” meaning you didn’t. Using this approach, a key result such as “Launch a new widget marketing campaign” might be graded a 1 or 0 depending on whether it was launched (1) or not (0). 



## 1.3 Gathering information to define scope
Define project scope status and differentiate in-scope, out-of-scope, and scope creep factors that affect reaching the project goal

Asking scope-defining questions
Imagine that while working in a restaurant management group, your manager calls and asks you to “update the dining space,” then quickly hangs up the phone without providing further instruction. In this initial handoff from the manager, you are missing a lot of information. How do you even know what to ask?

Let’s quickly recap the concept of scope. The scope provides the boundaries for your project. You define the scope to help identify necessary resources, resource costs, and a schedule for the project. 

In the situation we just described, here are some questions you might ask your manager in order to get the information you need to define the scope of the project:


#### Stakeholders
- How did you arrive at the decision to update the dining space? 
- Did the request originate from the restaurant owner, customers, or other stakeholders? 
- Who will approve the scope for the project? 

#### Goals
- What is the reason for updating the dining space? 
- What isn't working in the current dining space? 
- What is the end goal of this project? 

#### Deliverables
- Which dining space is being updated? 
- What exactly needs to be updated? 
- Does the dining space need a remodel? 

#### Resources
- What materials, equipment, and people will be needed? 
- Will we need to hire contractors? 
- Will we need to attain a floor plan and building permits? 

#### Budget
- What is the budget for this project? Is it fixed or flexible? 

#### Schedule
- How much time do we have to complete the project? 
- When does the project need to be completed? 

#### Flexibility
- How much flexibility is there? 
- What is the highest priority: hitting the deadline, sticking to the budget, or making sure the result meets all the quality targets? 

Taking the time to ask questions and ensure that you understand the scope of the project will help reduce expenses, rework, frustration, and confusion. Make sure you understand the who, what, when, where, why, and how as it applies to the scope. If you are missing any of that information, focus your questions on those elements. The initiation phase of the project sets the foundation for the project, so ensuring that you understand the scope and expectations during this stage is essential. 

## 1.4 Strategies for controlling scope creep

### Scope management best practices
The scope of a project can get out of control quickly—so quickly that you may not even notice it. Scope creep is when a project’s work starts to grow beyond what was originally agreed upon during the initiation phase. Scope creep can put stress on you, your team, and your organization, and it can put your project at risk. The effects of scope creep can hinder every aspect of the project, from the schedule to the budget to the resources, and ultimately, its overall success. 

- **Define your project’s requirements.** Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase. 

- **Set a clear project schedule.** Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.

- **Determine what is out of scope.** Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement. 

- **Provide alternatives.** Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.

- **Set up a change control process.** During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.

- **Learn how to say no.** Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. 

- **Collect costs for out-of-scope work.** If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for. 

### Triple Constraints of Project Management Explained & Simplified
"Do you want fast, cheap, or good?" That's the essential question of the project management triangle, a.k.a., the triple constraints. As with an actual triangle, you can't adjust one side without impacting the others.

The triple constraints in project management are scope, time, and cost.

- **Scope:** The deliverables and activities required to achieve a project's goals.
- **Time:** The schedule required to be followed to deliver a project on time.
- **Cost:** The budget, required to limit the resources used to deliver a project.

A project can be fast, cheap or good, but it can't be all three simultaneously. Quality will suffer.

Actionable Tips For Managing The Triple Constraint 
Here's a quick visual overview and guide of how to manage the triple constraint in real life.

## 1.5 Don't forget to land: Measuring project success

You will often hear companies celebrating the launch of a new product, service, or initiative, and it is important to remember that even when your project is out in the world, your work isn’t complete. When working on a project, the goal isn’t simply to launch it, but to land it. Landings occur once your project achieves a measure of success. As project managers, landings are what we strive for and what we celebrate. They are the ultimate reward for all of our efforts. 

#### Launching vs. landing a project
In project management, a project “launching” means you have delivered the final results of the project to the client or user. You can’t solely base project success on when the client accepts the project, though. Your work on a project won’t be complete until you “land” it by thoroughly measuring the results. This is when the **success criteria** and the metrics you defined initially when setting SMART goals will come in handy.  

Teams should be clear on what they are trying to accomplish, beyond just launching something to users. Will your project increase retention? Will your project speed up a product feature? Depending on the product and situation, the answers will differ, but it is important that your team aligns and works toward the same measurable goal. 


#### Tracking and communicating success criteria

##### Product quality 
The product, or final result, of a project has its own set of attributes that define success. The product attributes that are necessary for the product’s success include completeness in features, quality of features, unit cost, usability, etc. The extent that a product is complete will contribute to the product’s success. This can apply to any project in which you deliver a product or tangible outcome at the end. To keep us on track for success, we can create a list of product requirements to ensure that you do not miss anything. For example, if the project produces word processing software, you need basic features like text entry, formatting, saving, and printing. Since you require each feature to have a functional word processor by today’s standards, you include these features on your checklist. 

To measure the success of a product, consider including these metrics on your checklist: 

- Track if you implemented the product’s priority requirements
- Track and assess the product’s number of technical issues or defects
- Measure the percentage of features you delivered or released at the end of the project


#### What is important to the customers or stakeholders 
We have to pay attention to product metrics, but we also have to be mindful of stakeholder and customer additional expectations for features and objectives. In the word processor example, a stakeholder may want to add an additional functionality to easily create tables in a document with text. Additionally, a strategic goal of the organization could be to create word processor software with more collaborative ability than the word processors currently on the market. Each component is necessary in order to meet customer and stakeholder expectations. Think about what needs the project satisfies for your stakeholders or customers. These strategic goals tie back to the business case and the reason you initiated the project in the first place. Often, you can measure the fulfillment of strategic goals via user or customer metrics. Metrics to consider include:

- Evaluating user engagement with the product 
- Measuring stakeholder and customer satisfaction via surveys
- Tracking user adoption of the product by using sales data

#### Document, align, and communicate success
Understanding where we are and where we are going helps the project team determine if they are on track. As you learned in the video on this topic, you need to get clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations. There are many people involved with any project, and success will look different for each of them. You want to ask questions, such as: 
- Who ultimately says whether or not the project is successful? 
- What criteria will be measured to determine success? 
- What is the success of this project based on? 
- It is best practice to get the key stakeholders or the steering committee to review and approve your success criteria. This becomes a mutual agreement on how all parties define the success of the project.

Success criteria template click [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3OwXHMb25DpWHeJXzff9wqjuJSO6KH9aijNUAIUNpQ/template/preview?resourcekey=0-vgOO8PhLm_19ztOHb4eLJw)

#### Understand, assess and adapt
I believe that there needs to be a three-step approach to dealing with these situations, and the same approach can be applied whether it is your first project or if you have been managing projects for years. It’s just likely to become more of a subconscious effort with experience. Those three steps are:
1. Understand – What is the position each stakeholder has?
2. Assess – How does that position compare with the organizational view of the project?
3. Adapt – Adjust elements of the project to manage any variance between views and
perspectives.

## 1.6 The building blocks of a project dream team

Too big, too small, or just right?
Once you lay the foundation for your project by outlining your goals and expectations, it is time to build your dream team! Though before we can build our dream team, we need to figure out how many people we need. This number will largely depend on the size of the project itself. Complex projects with large divisions of work will usually require larger project teams. Simple projects with straightforward expectations may only require a few people on the project team. 

- **Technical skills** are highly valued, but they are not the only skills that are important for high functioning teams. 

- **Problem-solving skills** are a must for all team members, especially when it comes to large, complex projects. As a project manager, you will not be able to solve every problem for your team. At some point, they will need to use their own judgment to problem-solve and get the work done. 

- An underrated skill set for project team members are leadership skills. Strong **leadership skills** help team members navigate organizational boundaries and effectively communicate with stakeholders to generate buy-in. 

##### Who is available?
In projects, the availability of your team is always a big concern. This is especially true in Matrix organizations, where team members have multiple bosses. It is not uncommon to pull a team member onto another project before your project is complete. In a perfect world, you only pick those who can stay on the project for its entire life cycle. You may find that you don’t get to pick certain members of your team at all, which is called a pre-assignment. In these cases, the sponsor assigns team members to your project

##### What motivates them?
Be sure to take note of the motivation level of your team members and the impact it may have on your project. Just because a person is pre-assigned to a project, doesn’t necessarily mean they have low interest in it, but a person who proactively volunteered for it may have additional motivation to do the work.

##### Essential project roles
- Project Manager
- Stakeholders
    - Primary stakeholders: directly affected by the outcome of the project
    - Secondary stakeholders: indirectly affected by the outcome of the project
- Project team members
- Sponsor

## 1.7 Prioritizing stakeholders and generating their buy-in

learning to complete a stakeholder analysis and explain its significance. Let’s focus here on how to prioritize the various types of stakeholders that can exist on a project, generate stakeholder buy-in, and manage their expectations

### stakeholder analysis

key steps in the stakeholder analysis:

1. Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts. When generating this list, ask yourself:
    - Who is invested in the project? 
    - Who is impacted by this project? 
    - Who contributes to this project? 

2. Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder—this step helps you determine who your key stakeholders are. The higher the level of interest and influence, the more important it will be to prioritize their needs throughout the project. 

3. Assess stakeholders’ ability to participate and then find ways to involve them. Various types of projects will yield various types of stakeholders—some will be active stakeholders with more opinions and touchpoints and others will be passive stakeholders, preferring only high-level updates and not involved in the day-to-day. 

 **Pro tip:** You might want to form a steering committee during some projects. A steering committee is a collection of key stakeholders who have a high level of power and interest in a project. A steering committee can influence multiple departments within the organization, which means that they have the potential to release a greater number of resources to the project manager.

#### Quadrant 1: High Influence, High Interest (Upper Right)

Stakeholders in this quadrant have a significant influence on the project and are highly interested in its outcome. They can greatly impact project decisions and success. Examples might include project sponsors, key executives, or regulatory authorities. Responses for this quadrant include:

1. Engagement and Involvement:

    - Keep these stakeholders well-informed and engaged throughout the project lifecycle.
    - Involve them in decision-making processes, seeking their input and feedback.
    - Address their concerns promptly and effectively.

2. Regular Communication:
    - Schedule regular meetings or updates to keep them informed about project progress and any issues.
    - Tailor communication to their preferences and needs to ensure they remain supportive and engaged.


#### Quadrant 2: High Influence, Low Interest (Upper Left) 

Stakeholders in this quadrant have high influence but may not be deeply interested in the day-to-day project details. They might include senior managers who need to be informed but may not be actively engaged. Responses for this quadrant include:

1. Executive Summaries:
    - Provide high-level summaries of project progress and key decisions for their review.
    - Focus on the impact of the project on organizational goals and objectives.
2. Periodic Updates:
    - Provide periodic briefings or updates to ensure they are informed of major milestones and critical project changes.

#### Quadrant 3: Low Influence, High Interest (Bottom Right) 

Stakeholders in this quadrant have a high interest in the project but relatively low influence on its outcome. They are typically looking for updates and information about the project. Responses for this quadrant include:

1. Regular Updates:
    - Communicate project progress, risks, and updates to keep them engaged and informed.
    - Address their queries and concerns promptly to maintain their interest.
2. Stakeholder Feedback:
    - Seek their feedback on project plans, progress, and outcomes to ensure their perspective is considered.


#### Quadrant 4: Low Influence, Low Interest (Bottom Left)

Stakeholders in this quadrant have low influence on the project and limited interest in its details. They might include lower-level employees or departments not directly impacted by the project. Responses for this quadrant include:

1. General Communication:
    - Share general updates about the project's overall progress without overwhelming them with details.
    - Address any specific questions they may have, but avoid unnecessary inundation with project-related information.
2. Minimal Engagement:
    - Maintain a basic level of communication and engagement to keep them aware of the project without distracting them from their regular responsibilities.


**Pro tip:** While these tools help organize information, they do not necessarily make the difference between successful and unsuccessful stakeholder engagement. What will make for successful stakeholder engagement is the project manager’s ability to know their stakeholders’ motivations and inspirations. This takes time, interpersonal skills, and insight into the organization’s internal political workings. Remember, each project is different, and your project may need tweaks along the way as you grow as a project manager. Making necessary changes means you are doing something right. Just make sure to check in and ensure that you are well on track, engaging your stakeholders successfully, and delivering on your project!

#### Generating stakeholder buy-in 
Once you organize and assess your stakeholders, it is time to start making some decisions on whose buy-in is absolutely necessary for success, whose requirements deserve the most attention, and what level of communication each stakeholder will require.

Gaining key stakeholder buy-in is essential to ensuring that your project is not deprioritized or deprived of resources. 

Tips for gaining key stakeholder buy-in include: 

- Clearly mapping the work of the project to the goals of the stakeholder.
- Describing how the project aligns with the goals of the stakeholder's department or team.
- Listening to feedback from the stakeholder and finding ways to incorporate their feedback into the project's charter where appropriate.

Manage your stakeholders’ expectations by presenting a realistic view of your team’s abilities. Do not over-promise and under-deliver!
