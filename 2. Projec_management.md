# The project life cycle

### Initiate the project
In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

- Who are the stakeholders?
- What are the client’s or customer’s goals?
- What is the purpose and mission of the project?
- What are the measurable objectives for the team?
- What is the project trying to improve? 
- When does this project need to be completed? 
- What skills and resources will the project require? 
- What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

### Make a plan
In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 

Create a detailed project plan. 
- What are the major milestones? 
- What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  

Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

### Execute the project
In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 
- Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 
- Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 
- Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.
- Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.
- Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

### Close the project
In this phase, close out the project.

- Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 
- Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.
- Take time with your team to celebrate your successes! 

Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.

Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.

Reflect on ways to improve in the future.

Key takeaway
Each phase of the project life cycle has its own significance and reason for existing. By following the project life cycle, you’re ensuring that you are: 
- Capturing the expectations of your customer
- Setting your project up for success with a plan
- Executing project tasks and addressing any issues that arise 
- Closing out your project to capture any lessons learned 

# Learning Organization's Culture

It is important to learn about the culture of the organization where you work or want to work. Understanding the company’s culture can help you navigate your team through a project. Consider this quote from Peter Drucker, an expert on management: "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." Drucker is implying that the culture of a company always influences its success, regardless of how effective the company’s business model may be.

### Ask questions
You can learn about an organization's culture by asking questions of management and peers. It can be helpful to ask these questions in the interview phase to better understand the company’s culture before accepting a position. You might want to ask questions about:

### Atmosphere
- What is the company’s dress code? 
- How do people typically share credit at this company? 
- Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail?
- How do managers support and motivate their team?
- How do people in this role interact with customers and users?
- When and how do team members give feedback to one another?
- What are some workplace traditions?
- What are some of the ways the company celebrates success?

### Policies
- What are the policies around sick days and vacation?
- Does the company allow for employee flexibility (e.g., working from home, flexible working hours)?
- What policies are in place that support employees sharing their identity in the workplace?

### Processes
- What is the company’s onboarding process?
- How do employees measure the impact of their work?

### Values
- What are the company’s mission and value statements?
- How might the person in this role contribute to the organization’s mission?
- How does the organization support professional development and career growth?

### Listen to people’s stories
Listening to what current employees have to say and how they portray the company will give you great insight.

- What were employees' experiences with similar projects in the past? 
- What can they tell you about key stakeholders and customers? 

### Take note of company rituals
Rituals can be powerful drivers of culture. They engage people and help instill a sense of shared purpose and experience. 

- How are birthdays and holidays celebrated? 
- Do employees generally eat lunch at the same time and in the same place? 

Watch employee interactions: Observing how employees interact can help you tailor your interaction style to the company norm. 
- Are employee interactions more formal or informal in nature? 
- Are ideas solicited from employees in different roles?
